Owner: Brian Manuputty

This guide involves 4 steps:

1. Creating a user
2. Updating the database
3. Securing a password link
4. Sending a password email.

# 1. Creating A User

1. Before you start make sure you have the following info ready:
    - **Email address**
    - **Password** - Create a safe one here: [https://1password.com/password-generator/](https://1password.com/password-generator/) and temporarily store it somewhere. Be sure to delete it after you create the user.

# 2. Updating the database

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the organisation of the user is present in the database. Every user should have an organisation by design. For instructions on how to create an organisation [click here](https://www.notion.so/How-To-Manually-Create-Organisations-c6eadc89e53c4b65907da4b911723364?pvs=21).

</aside>

Each user should have the following data in the database set up before logging into the app for the first time:

- [ ]  Organisation document
- [ ]  User document
    - [ ]  User Profiles document
- [ ]  Organisation member document
- [ ]  Organisation member custom claim

### 2.1 User Document

1. Make sure you have the user id ready, then make a new document in the `users` collection and give it the ID of the user you just created.

2. Fetch the document and click *Edit Document as JSON*
    
    ![Untitled](How%20To%20Manually%20Add%20Users%20to%20Potty%20Portal%20ff19feb3f0054e15b5790ee01937a8f8/Untitled%205.png)
    
3. Fill in the following JSON with the appropriate email and timestamps and click `Save`.
    
    ```json
    {
      "created_at": {
        "__time__": "2024-05-03T09:12:42.033Z"
      },
      "email": "email@email.com",
      "updated_at": {
        "__time__": "2024-05-03T09:12:42.033Z"
      }
    }
    ```
    

### 2.2 User Profiles Document

Inside the `users` document find the `user_profiles` sub collection and create a similar document with the same ID and the following JSON. Update the display name, timestamps and press save:

```json
{
  "created_at": {
    "__time__": "2024-06-20T20:10:33.844Z"
  },
  "display_name": "Femke",
  "organisation_id": "nVZGd1IqL7gQgzpOYTWN",
  "updated_at": {
    "__time__": "2024-06-20T20:10:33.844Z"
  }
}
```

### 2.3 Organisation Member Document

Find the organisation document of the user in the `organisations` collection. Underneath this document find or create the sub collection `organisation_members` and paste in the following JSON. Update the timestamps, fill in your ID in the `created_by` and `updated_by` fields and fill in the `user_id` of the user as fields as well as the *document id*. Lastly remove any non relevant roles from `roles`.

```json
{
  "created_at": {
    "__time__": "2024-12-02T10:33:25.523999Z"
  },
  "created_by": "QkfQFGJNQTZIcN3irS9JXfYWeAM2",
  "roles": [
    "owner",
    "editor",
    "viewer"
  ],
  "updated_at": {
    "__time__": "2024-12-02T10:33:33.032999Z"
  },
  "updated_by": "QkfQFGJNQTZIcN3irS9JXfYWeAM2",
  "user_id": "QkfQFGJNQTZIcN3irS9JXfYWeAM2"
}
```

### 3.3 Organisation Custom Claim

In order for our security rules to work our users must have their `organisation_id` saved in their token as a custom claim. Before proceeding make sure you have the organisation ID in your clipboard.

1. Start by locating the user in the *Authentication* tab in Firefoo, right click the entry and choose ‚Äò*Edit User Details‚Äô*.

2. Locate the label *Claims* and update/create the JSON with the `organisation_id`.
