**MANUAL WAYâ€¦**

1. Update the following JSON to fit the new organisation details.

- Fill in the address if known, otherwise leave the fields empty.
- Leave location type as default unless you know this organisation has their own custom location types.
    - If an organisation has custom location types, communicate with developers which ones they are and how to put them in here.
- Fill in the name and timestamps.
- Fill in your own ID at created_by and updated_by.
